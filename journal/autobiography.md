# CompSci Autobiography
### Tyler Jang


#### Historical Computing Experience
I first began coding in Scratch in middle school, and while I thoroughly enjoyed it and continued work outside of class, I lacked the motivation and
the guidance to continue my studies in programming. 

During high school, through some introductory computer science classes and APCS, I managed to pick up a bit of JavaScript and Java. I enjoyed the learning and worked on a
handful of experimental projects outside of class. My experience remained relatively small in scale.

Since arriving at Duke, I have taken EGR 103, CS 201, and CS 250. I've thoroughly enjoyed these classes, and have since become a TA for EGR 103,
helping first-time programmers pick up some basic coding skills.

#### Why Study CompSci
Like many others, I find the thrill of problem-solving in coding to be electric. I have an acquaintance who regularly wears a shirt that reads, "what you do when you should be working is what you should be doing."
I regularly procrastinate on other projects by working on my CS projects, and I hope that will remain true in this class.

#### My Daily Experiences
Through my Code+ internship last summer, I became acquainted with Raspberry Pi and some Open Source software. I've since worked to try and tinker with a Pi 
(mainly in Python and Bash) to add additional features to it. While work has been slow and discontinuous, I hope that I will accomplish a number of my goals with the project over the course of the semester.

#### Best Programming Experience
My greatest and most thorough experience in programming came from my Code+ internship last summer. I worked in a group of 3 to create a basic network security device on a Raspberry Pi Model 3B.
I worked primarily on the back-end, programming in bash and leveraging various Open Source packages on top of OpenWRT.

While the results of the project were mixed, I worked with a great team and great mentors to learn a great deal in a hands-on project with real applications.

#### Most Favorite Programming Project
My favorite  programming experience was designing/implementing a processor in Logisim in CS 250. That was the only class during that semester that I felt I had a firm intuition for, and while "programming" 
is a bit of a stretch to describe the mundanity of Logisim, I enjoyed the simple and upfront logic of it.

#### Design Thoughts
In designing, I typically outline the structure of my programs/classes before I write them. Too often, however, I fall into the trap of writing helper methods to "bodge" my code together
rather than stopping, stepping away, and seeing what better design choices should have been/be made. I'm usually less likely to fall into this trap when I'm more familiar with the particular
package(s)/class(es). 

#### CompSci 308 Goals
I hope that this course will prepare me through technical experience and best practices to succeed during my internship this summer at Appian.
While I have a fair amount of theoretical computer science experience, through CS 201 and CS 250, I have very little practical experience that encompasses full design projects.

#### Using Programming in the Future
I hope to work in software development as a career, so this may be one of the most important courses I take while at Duke. I've always enjoyed problem-solving, and I've always found other people in the field
to be immensely supportive and kind. 

With regard to my specific interests, at the moment I have an interest in increasing my experience with cybersecurity as well as possibly experimenting with
machine learning.
