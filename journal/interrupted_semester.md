# Successful Outcomes
### Tyler Jang

#### Things Lost
This crisis has brought chaos and uncertainty to so many lives over the past few months and will continue to 
wreak havoc for the next several months. I am very fortunate that I currently have a stable financial situation and am in good health.
With that being said, this crisis has turned much of my life upside down.

In addition to much of the initial and continuing anxiety surrounding uncertainties, both logistically and interpersonally, I have lost many of the following, many of which I had intensely looked forward to:
 - Close contact with friends and my partner
 - Brotherhood week with APO on campus this spring
 - A chance to compete in cyber competitions this spring
 - Strong, stable internet access
 - A sense of a stable home where I feel comfortable
 - Weekly Panda Express and Harris Teeter sub runs

I recognize that the future brings more uncertainties, and I may yet lose the following:
 - My summer internship (and its commensurate income and professional experience)
 - Time in Virginia with friends
 - The good health of friends and family

#### Concerns and Confidences
The biggest logistical challenge facing me for the rest of the semester is with regarding to my family's location.
I have been living in our cabin in Willow, Alaska for the past week as my family handled packing up items and other logistical challenges associated with moving.

At this moment, we plan to return to Anchorage on Monday (3/30), before flying to Arizona Monday night and moving into our new house there. This plan hinges on many other events, including:
 - Flights to Arizona not being cancelled
 - Airlines continuing to permit travel with pets (we have 2 dogs)
 - Stable weather
 - Our own health
 - Stable resources and internet access in Arizona
 - No major travel restrictions

Assuming all of this goes to plan and we remain healthy, things will settle back "to normal" within a couple of weeks. With that being said, this crisis has demonstrated it has no respect for "plans."

Within this class, I am hopeful for the chance to learn more about JUnit Tests, something I had intended to explore already this semester, but which had been pushed aside by other priorities.
I believe this is an essential skill for any software developer's toolkit.

I am also happy that I will be closer geographically to many of my friends from Duke (although further from most of my high school friends).

#### Hopes and Positive Outcomes
In the best-case scenario, the health of myself and those I care about would remain well, and we will see a slow return to
"business as usual." This is unlikely, however, and we will have to adapt to the changes and challenges that face us in the coming months.

It is my hope that I will still be able to learn about as much as I had while on campus during this semester, and time is much less of a limiting factor
than it once was. Hopefully I can leverage it for both my own mental health and my educational enrichment.
