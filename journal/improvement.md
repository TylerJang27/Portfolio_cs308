# Improvement Assessment

## Programming Skills

 * My worst coding experience during this course was with the first project. I was a novice, and I knew how inheritance and classes worked, but I didn't understand how to leverage it.
 Tasked with the same project now, I would have developed a drastically different and more stable/flexible/rigorous program. It is really amazing how far I've come. But, the initial dive into 
 unfamiliar waters with little guidance served its commensurate shock. I don't believe I will experience such a shock many more times, and this course has certainly provided me with the skills and drive to weather such a storm.

 * My best coding experience from this class was during the Parser projects. I believe that I wrote some of the best code I have written in my entire life. I spent a great deal of time thinking about my program design, compared to the amount of time I spent actually coding.
 I ended up deciding on what I later realized was a Mediator design pattern, in which I created a couple of classes that were a go-between in executing the behavior of other classes, supplying them with the necessary arguments to execute user-defined functions at runtime.
 This is something that I was incredibly proud of, and it was linked to one of my first dives into functional interfaces. I am incredibly satisfied with my design from that project, and it served to provide me with the momentum I needed to work well on our final project.

 * This semester I have had the privilege of expanding my skillset in three primary ways:
    * Git It Together: This was my first experience using Git on a large scale, other than just for basic group programming. This was the first time that I actually understood how to leverage branches to group meaningful changes together and to minimize large conflicts
    across a project. I became particularly fond of using a develop branch to stage our group changes, and this encouraged more frequent integration (and of course less conflicts) because of the easier peace-of-mind associated with the "develop" as opposed to the "master" branch.
    * Functional Programming: This was also my first real encounter with lambda functions outside of a limited scope in Python. Lambda functions offer a whole new dimension of opportunity of coding, to encapsulate behavior into a singular call that moves beyond the encapsulation of an object or class.
    I truly found a calling during my design of factories using functional interfaces, particularly Functions and Consumers, for the final game project.
    * Design Patterns: I happily discovered during some of the projects in this class that I had already been subscribing to some design patterns. This is likely due to the background and education I have previously received in computer science.
    Particularly, during the parser project, I discovered after the fact that I was using a mediator to govern my use of user-defined functions in our SLogo environment.
    But more importantly, I've learned to follow design patterns in the sticking to them more religiously. While I may have created something akin to a factory before this class, I would have tacked on additional behaviors that would have muddled my code and hampered extensibility.
    Referring to design patterns has lent me guiding principles that emphasize simplicity and encapsulation in programming.

## Teamwork

 * My worst experience this semester was with our work on the SLogo Parser project. I found a calling in some of the back end development of Commands, particularly user-defined Commands that could be inputted by the user.
 With our team dynamic, we agreed to let Dennis work on the Controller and the Parser. While we originally were happy with this setup, we slowly realized that Parser was a bigger dragon than we'd bargained for, and it was much to big for one person to manage, on top of Controller responsibilities.
 While we tried to share the burden of Parser, much of the code he had already written was difficult to wade through, and none of us were particularly comfortable with reflection.
 Because of this, the problem snowballed, until the time came for us to merge everything together and remove the remainder of our bugs, and our final project crashed.
 We weren't able to produce nearly the goal we wanted, and while we all did great individual work, our collaborative effort was rather disappointing. From this experience I learned three things:
    * Balanced and communicative group work is of the utmost importance.
    * Starting early on work is essential.
    * Regular, frequent integration is essential.

 * My best team experience this semester was during our final project. We were able to choose our own teams, and our group had already developed a sense of trust and camaraderie. We weren't afraid of stepping on each others' toes, and we
 were willing and able to question everyone else's ideas. We effectively divided up our roles, making sure that if one person were more significantly burdened, someone else would be there to share the weight. And perhaps most effective of all,
 we had many team meetings. We went one week with 4 full team meetings, and we have since averaged about 2-3 full team meetings per week since then. We've had even more meetings in subteams, and we've formed a very cohesive group.
 It has certainly helped that we've had more time to work on the project, but I feel that our regular and devoted communication has improved our experience tremendously.
 
 * I should hope that my team mates have respect for my communication practices. I work very hard to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that we sent manageable internal team goals ahead of our official delivery goals.
 During the final project, my teammate Andrew and I decided that we would work to document all of our meetings and create other documentation of our discussions. This was helpful not just in terms of course assignments, but it also
 provided meaningful goals that we could refer to and modify as necessary. I work very hard, through my commenting practices, meeting documentation, and logical design, to ensure that communication is one our team's highest priorities,
 and I hope that my teammates recognize this. 

## Personal

 * I have always prided myself on my skills as a debugger. I work as a teaching assistant in another programming class, EGR 103, and so I frequently am asked to help other students both
 think critically about their code and debug. I'm personally a fan of print statements as a method of debugging, and I am rarely confronted with a coding challenge for which I can't find a creative solution.
 Historically, this has manifested in some very bodged products, but in this class I have learned to stick more to established design patterns and fixed APIs. 
 This class has been an opportunity for me as well to dabble in JUnit testing, but it is something that I need to continue to work on so that most of my debugging can occur earlier in the design process rather than at times of
 integration or new feature rollout.

 * Unfortunately, I have not had that much experience working on large coding projects. Because of this, I have yet to develop a great gauge for how much time different programming tasks may take me.
 I am a very fast typist and a fast programmer, but not a flawless programmer. I am rarely able to estimate with great accuracy how long completing a task, including debugging, may take me. This extends beyond just coding.
 It is something that our final project has brought more brightly to my attention, as we produced code we were very proud of, but we fell slowly behind our sprint goals.
 I hope and believe that as I continue in this field, I will develop a better internal compass for time management and time estimation.

 * This course was my first experience learning about new packages at speed. We were tasked with becoming competent with XML reading, reflection, JavaFX, and other packages within about a week so that we could deploy them into our projects.
 This is a task and a timeline that I was previously completely unused to. Nevertheless, I have gotten by and learned my fair share of different technologies. I hope in the future that I can work just as well to learn
 quickly and at scale so that my skillset can continue to expand, and I plan to keep records of documentation and examples that I can reference and test so that these skills do not fade.
