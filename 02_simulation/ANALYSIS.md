### Name: 

> This is the link to the [assignment](http://www.cs.duke.edu/courses/compsci308/current/assign/02_simulation/):


## Overall Design

* Bullets are made with asterisks

1. You can order things with numbers.

You can put links to commits like this: [My favorite commit](https://coursework.cs.duke.edu/compsci308_2019spring/example_bins/commit/ae099c4aa864e61bccb408b285e8efb607695aa2)


## Your Design

You can put blocks of code in here like this:
```java
    /**
     * Returns sum of all values in given list.
     */
    public int getTotal (Collection<Integer> data) {
        int total = 0;
        for (int d : data) {
            total += d;
        }
        return total;
    }
```


## Flexibilty

You can also just write some text

in separate paragraphs.


## Alternate Designs

Here is a graphical look at my design:

![This is cool, too bad you can't see it](online-shopping-uml-example.png "An alternate design")

made from [a tool that generates UML from existing code](http://staruml.io/).
